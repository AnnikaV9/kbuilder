 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

A bash script for Arch Linux that allows you to build one of the
four officially supported kernels locally with your own optional 
patches and configuration, under a different package name.

For example, you could fetch the sources of the linux-lts kernel, 
apply a patch that optimizes the kernel for intel processors, 
and install that kernel as linux-lts-intel-optimized.
